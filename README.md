# HousingPrices
This repository contains my solution to Kaggle's Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. My solution is focused on getting extensive insight into the data in order to develop meaningful strategies for filling in the missing data and fixing data abnormalities.

After data cleaning is performed, a regression model is developed that consists of 5 individual regressors. Their predictions are averaged in order to obtain the final prediction. This tecnhique achieves reasonably good results on the dataset and got placed in the top 13% amongst all competition participants.
